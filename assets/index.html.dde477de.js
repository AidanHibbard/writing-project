While I wanted to write about Peer to Peer file sharing, I think the grown association it has with piracy makes this too large a topic to take on. Sources were also light. I want to do this on a website again, I learned a lot when I did this last, and have found a reliable way to make it work. I think this is a great choice as I can still write my paper in a document editor like Word, then convert the file to Mark Down, so it can easily be transferred to a web page. VuePress, a document framework takes markdown files, then generates a fully accessible website like what we got our sources from in WR 65 (Although VuePress is far more modern.)</p><p>Right to Repair is critical to move to a greener infrastructure. Not only does the manufacturer owning the repairability put unneeded burden on the consumer by traveling to, shipping, or scheduling a repair. Manufactures owning all repairability of a device creates tons of waste, manufacturers don\u2019t want to hold parts for long so planned obsolescence becomes the norm. When a repair may be too costly, or difficult on new devices they are often tossed rather than salvaged.</p><p>When you save the planet you also save some money. Right to Repair saves you the bank holds for shipped repairs, the gas driving to a best buy, or saving you from a costly upgrade. When your screen breaks, doing an often simple repair by swapping it saves you the time, and labor cost of a \u201Cprofessional.\u201D The pandemic has made this a rising issue, as shops close people are left stranded waiting often weeks to get a simple repair handled on new appliances, and devices. Time is expensive to people, and the amount you save by doing your own services can often be critical if a device is completely dead otherwise.</p><p>How many times have you looked at your iPhone, and thought it would be really expensive to drop it? New devices with proprietary parts are built entirely to lock the consumer out. Apple, amongst other manufactures, have opted to make their own proprietary screws that consumers have to buy tools to work on. You shouldn\u2019t need a movement to know that\u2019s plain wrong, creating pitfalls for consumers to sell your own \u201Cprofessionals\u201D is extraordinarily legal. Imagine working on your 2022 car in your driveway.</p><p>Jobs depend on the right to repair, the rest of the above points have been unsurprisingly argued against by manufacturers for years. People&#39;s jobs though, are really no joke. Mom, and Pop repair shops whether it be for cars, your appliances, or tech held a respectable place in society. Nothing better than being able to call a local shop about a washing machine, find out it\u2019s easily replaceable with spare parts, and have it fixed by someone nearby. Restricting manuals, parts, and other services from professionals leaves it up to engineers who can understand electrical engineering well enough to repair a Mac by site. This prices people out, killing an economy, and a generation that built their lives repairing what they owned.</p><p>I lied in my last criteria, Apple has, can, and will argue against all things. Apple is the poster child for flipping the finger to consumers, in a recent post they announced some minor right to repair services, but that doesn\u2019t undo the years of damage they have already wrought. Every argument from trained professionals being better than your neighbor Joe, to literally building a piece of hardware into the device that breaks unless it\u2019s repaired by professionals. There\u2019s no shortage of articles, statements, and litigation spewed by large corporations seeking to protect their intellectual property. While that may sound noble, when was the last time you swapped the battery in your phone?</p><p>A working thesis for my topic might be; Right to Repair should be ingrained into our legal system regardless of Intellectual Property laws, removing a burden on consumers, moving towards greener infrastructure, and keeping technology fixable.</p>',9);function r(i,n){return o}var h=e(a,[["render",r],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
