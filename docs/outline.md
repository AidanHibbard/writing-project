   - Repair technicians have a needed role within society, providing consumers a local professional
   - Restricting repair procedures closes local repair shops that many agricultural producers may depend on for aging machinery repairs. (ie. John Deere conflict)
- Cost
   - No costly upgrades after devices loses manufacturer support
   - No choosing between a costly seller warranty, or out of pocket repair from manufacture servicing monopoly
   - Companies using products can hire on hand support staff rather than relying on the manufacturer
## Counter Arguments
- Protecting Intellectual Property
   - Keeping devices hard to access protects company secrets
   - Repairs especially those involving software patches violate DRM, and Eula agreements
   - Market could be flooded by knock off, cheaper parts that lead to issues
- Always have product repaired by manufacturer authorized professional
   - Devices may have unsafe parts to disassemble without proper training
   - Device could be damaged by user modification or fix leading to a higher cost repair
