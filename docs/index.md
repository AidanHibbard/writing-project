### <center>Right to Repair should be ingrained into our legal system, regardless of safety or intellectual property claims.</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From multi-million dollar tractors to the smartphone in your pocket, Right to Repair should be ingrained into our legal system, regardless of safety or intellectual property claims. For years manufactures have damaged the environment, killed jobs, and racked up substantial costs for consumers. Manufacturers argue they’re protecting company secrets, and that their professional technicians can provide accurate service. While proponents for the new legislation argue that level of control keeps consumers from owning their own property.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of environmental damage [e-waste](https://www.deschutes.org/solidwaste/page/electronic-waste-e-waste) creates is staggering, for years manufactures have created proprietary wires, and components that eventually get tossed. How many various phone chargers did we go through during the days of battling flip phone designs? How many device chargers do you have laying around from your Macs, and iPhone upgrades? Right to Repair groups look to install legislation like the recent [European push for charging standards](https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-deal-single-mobile-charging-port-by-year-end-is-possible-lawmaker-says-2022-02-15/), hoping to help slow the needless creation, and tossing of wires. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s not only the generations of cables filling our landfills, out of warranty, and “unrepairable” devices that sweep the world's garbage. [Amazon](https://www.ifixit.com/News/35189/its-time-to-stop-making-excuses-for-amazons-disposable-tech), and [Apple](https://globuswarwick.com/2021/01/21/the-e-waste-problem-a-case-study-of-apple/) are some of the largest generators of this waste creating devices that out of their provided warranties can be as costly as a new device to repair leading consumers to toss their defective products en masse. Providing the resources for those willing to take on the task of a repair can help reduce the 50 Million Metric Tonnes of e-waste created each year. Creating device manufacturing standards, and opening repair procedures is critical to moving to a greener infrastructure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you save the environment, you also save a solid amount of money. Not only does creating an open standard for manufactures lower the cost for parts, you save crucial time, and money avoiding a manufacturer repair monopoly. No more having to get your car's oil changed done by a manufacturer shop so you can have the engine light turned off by a proprietary tool. No more waiting weeks to get an appliance repaired by a manufacturer if it’s provided in your area, or purchasing a costly new device if not. Companies can avoid costly down times by having repair techs on hand, rather than relying on the required manufacturer repair monopoly. This last example has been highlighted across industries for years. However, Linus Sebastian of LinusTechTips on youtube had a run in with Apple recently. Where the company refused to provide service on a computer even when the consumer was willing to pay out of pocket for an out of warranty repair. After money was drained in down time, and hunting for repair leads, the media group had to fly out a 3rd party mac Repair Engineer who had the skills to repair the device without the manual. This highlighted the issue that unless you have extensive funds, or a large following backing you, a professional consumer could not repair their multi thousand dollar device.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devices like our cars are becoming more software than hardware, an issue in our food supply line has begun to bring this to a spotlight as [John Deere in recent years has also come under fire from lawsuits claiming difficulty in repair](https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/equipment/article/2022/03/02/john-deere-faces-growing-list-right). Software restrictions on farm equipment, and our own devices like [Apples T2 Chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_T2) create difficulties in amateur repairs. Especially as climate change takes a toll on the time farmers have to raise crops, getting machines serviced is more critical than corporate funds so we can continue to feed the world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the entry gates to repair manuals also helps create jobs across the globe. By allowing 3rd party repair centers to operate in line with manufacturer's guidelines to receive repair procedures, parts, and tools shops can remain open to provide consumers a local service. However this can be used to put shops under the thumb of manufacturers, Louis Rossman an independent device service engineer provides out of warranty services to peoples old devices goes into depth about the hoops a tech must jump through to stay in good standing. This can be costly for shops to continue to pay fees on fees to operate in an already declining market.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By creating basic technological manufacturing standards, and not keeping mom & pop shops under manufacturer thumbs we can continue to create better consumer products. With open standards, and less gated repair authorizations we create jobs, bringing upticks to the economy. Ultimately laying the tracks to take us to a greener infrastructure, helping protect the planet for us, and future generations.
