## Intellectual Property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual Property Laws in the United States are essentially the Bible, giving manufacturers sweeping rights to protect their devices how they see fit. From [Apple's Proprietary anti-repair traps](https://www.treehugger.com/the-pentalobe-screw-and-apples-war-against-self-repair-4857481) in their devices to [Tesla's continued fight against consumer repairs](https://electrek.co/2020/10/14/tesla-fights-right-to-repair-initiative-over-cybersecurity-concerns/) there’s no shortage of examples of companies looking to protect their secrets. As tools become more software dependent, users who use newer products often agree to an Eula service agreement to use the software like on a new phone. By repairing, modifying, or changing any of the code to repair your own device this can land you in serious legal trouble. Todd J. Janzen of [Janzen Schroeder  ag Law](https://www.aglaw.us/) posted [an opinion piece surrounding the John Deere conflict](https://www.aglaw.us/janzenaglaw/2017/3/29/fixing-the-right-to-repair) in which he argues that the copyright protection on manufacturer software of 90+ years is too long. While the Right to Repair lobbyists may demand zero, a common ground must be met, to which Janzen suggests shortening the length to ten years to help maintain IP protection, but provide consumers a safety net after a time when warranties usually end. There must be a point where the individual no longer depends on the manufacturer to keep a no longer support product alive.

## Professional Repair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the demand for more efficiency, and uses in devices rises so does the complication of each component inside. This drastically raises the entry level for any kind of repair, especially on smaller devices where even a botched screen repair can leave you worse off than before. With the amount of time we depend on our screens going up the batteries packed inside have to keep up with the times. This has led to increased risk when the possibility of popping one with a smaller screw driver is so high. Apple, in response, [restricted battery repairs](https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/07/iphone-battery-service-message/) to authorized retailers, flashing a constant warning in settings if a non-authorized battery is detected. Shortly after Apple also announced they are [pairing screens to the logic board](https://www.ifixit.com/News/apple-is-discouraging-screen-repair-with-an-iphone-11-genuine-warning) to lock a device if a non-authorized screen is detected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, if it hasn’t already, should startle you. Imagine going to swap the battery on your car, and because you didn’t purchase one from the dealer you are now stuck with a warning light. Now imagine you can only get rid of that light by spending the extra money on the dealer battery, but, because you swapped your own, the vehicle warranty is voided. Now you are left footing the bill out of pocket, just because the manufacturer installed a light in a place that you can’t not see it. This is already happening, with all of our devices, and unless we do something now even a simple oil change may land you a costly punishment.
